# Weather-prediction-using-logistic-regression

This project focuses on predicting weather conditions based on various environmental factors using logistic regression. By analyzing historical weather data and employing logistic regression techniques, we develop a model capable of predicting weather conditions with a high degree of accuracy.

**Project Overview**
Accurate weather prediction is essential for various industries and activities, including agriculture, transportation, and outdoor events planning. This project addresses the need for reliable weather forecasting by leveraging machine learning techniques to predict weather conditions based on relevant features and historical data.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project contains historical weather data, including features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and more. The dataset is collected from reliable sources and curated to ensure data quality and relevance for weather prediction.

**Methodology**
Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for model training.

**Feature Selection:** Relevant features are selected from the dataset based on their significance in predicting weather conditions. Feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance are employed to identify the most informative features.

**Model Training:** Logistic regression is chosen as the predictive model due to its simplicity and interpretability. The logistic regression model is trained on the preprocessed dataset to learn the relationship between input features and weather conditions.

**Model Evaluation:** The trained logistic regression model is evaluated using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance in predicting different weather conditions.

**Model Interpretation:** The coefficients of the logistic regression model are interpreted to understand the impact of each feature on predicting specific weather conditions. This interpretation helps in gaining insights into the underlying relationships between input features and weather outcomes.
